## Background

New annual HIV infections have been increasing steadily in Uganda despite a decreasing HIV prevalence. This thesis aimed to identify sexual behavior, socio-demographic, biological, and other factors associated with HIV infection.

## Data Overview

Data was extracted from the **2011 Uganda AIDS Indicator Survey (UAIS)**, a nationally representative two-stage stratified sample. The analysis focused on sexually active respondents aged 15-59 who provided a blood sample for HIV and syphilis testing (n=18,395).

## Methodology

Two models were employed to examine associations between various factors and HIV infection:

1. **Design-based Logistic Regression**: Used to explore the association between gender, self-perceived risk of getting HIV, and HIV infection.
2. **Classification Tree**: Used to identify complex, higher-level interaction effects between different variables.

### Key Models:

- **First Model (Logistic Regression)**: Investigated the interaction between gender and self-perceived risk of HIV infection with actual HIV status.
- **Second Model (Classification Tree)**: Focused on identifying important interaction effects.

## Results

### Prevalence of HIV

The overall HIV prevalence in the study population was **8.15%**.

### Key Findings:

1. **Self-Perceived Risk of HIV**:
   - Males with a **low self-perceived risk** were more likely to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors.
   - After adjusting for other factors, **self-perceived risk** was significantly associated with HIV infection in **uncircumcised males** (p-value = 0.0018).
   - The odds of HIV infection among uncircumcised males with a high self-perceived risk were **65% higher** compared to uncircumcised male respondents with a low self-perceived risk of getting HIV (Adjusted OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.21–2.26).
   - Circumcised males with a high self-perceived risk of contracting HIV had **49% lower odds** of HIV infection compared to uncircumcised males with a high self-perceived risk of contracting HIV (Adjusted OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.28–0.92).

2. **Socio-Demographic and Behavioral Factors**:
   - Being **married** (Adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.08–2.24), **divorced/separated** (Adjusted OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.35–3.26), or **widowed** (Adjusted OR = 3.74, 95% CI: 2.24–6.23) was associated with higher odds of HIV infection compared to being **never married**.
   - **Alcohol consumption during sex** (Adjusted OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.03–1.58) and engaging in **commercial/exchange sex** (Adjusted OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.36–3.17) were significantly associated with higher HIV infection rates.
   - Having **multiple lifetime sex partners** (2-3 partners: Adjusted OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.17–2.08; 4 or more partners: Adjusted OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.47–2.68) also increased the odds of HIV infection.
   - Having **biological children away from home** was associated with higher odds of HIV infection (1-2 children: Adjusted OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.15–1.77; 3-4 children: Adjusted OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.01–1.73).

### Classification Tree Results:

The classification tree identified **four potential interaction patterns**, with one being statistically significant:

- The interaction between **having an STI** and **total lifetime number of sex partners** was found to be significant after further evaluation in the logistic regression model.

## Conclusion

This study provides important insights into Uganda's HIV epidemic. Several factors, including socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, and biological factors, were found to be significantly associated with HIV infection. Notably, **self-perceived risk of HIV infection** was significantly associated with actual HIV infection in **uncircumcised males**, suggesting a potential area for future research.

Further studies, particularly prospective ones, may be necessary to confirm these findings.
